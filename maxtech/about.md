This is my personal, technical blog.
I'm interested in all sorts of things, ranging form AI/ML/DL to generative art to programming languages to cloud computing to crowd-sourced computing (which, these days, means blockchains).
You can find my personal code on [Github](https://github.com/scnerd/).
I am a professional developer and researcher (though I have to admit, it's still strange to refer to myself as "a professional"... if I'm the kind of person writing the software the world runs on, we're all doomed),
 with a career background in defense and data science.
